This is a reading list for students, practitioners, and researchers interested in the general area of programmable data planes. Topics include employed hardware or software architectures, algorithms, as well as applications leveraging programmable data plane technologies. The reading list completes the manuscript:

> Oliver Michel, Roberto Bifulco, Gábor Rétvári, and Stefan Schmid. *[The Programmable Data Plane: Abstractions, Architectures, Algorithms, and Applications]()*, IEEE TechRxiv Preprint Server

The reading list is organized into a rough hierarchy based on the major topics of Architectures, Abstractions, Algorithms, Applications, and Miscellanea; note that this hierarchy is more or less arbitrary and the purpose is just to have some organization at all. Please note that many of the linked papers are behind paywalls. We double-checked that all listed papers can be accessed freely by a moderate amount of googling; we still provide the paywall links as user-provided PDFs often do not prove overly stable over time. 

We highly appreciate contributions to this reading list from the community to keep the list current and make it more complete. Instructions for contributing can be found in the [repository's README file](https://github.com/programmabledataplanereview/programmabledataplanereview.github.io).
