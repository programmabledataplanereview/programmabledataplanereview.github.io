        We first discuss the viability of software switching and then review dataflow graph abstractions, also discussing, e.g., Click, ClickOS, and software NICs. We proceed by revisiting literature on match-action abstractions, discussing OVS and PISCES. We conclude with a review on packet I/O libraries.

                The paper is the first to study the performance limitations when building both software routers and software virtual routers on commodity CPU platforms. The authors observe that the fundamental performance bottleneck is the memory system, and that through careful mapping of tasks to CPU cores one can achieve very high forwarding rates. The authors also identify principles for the construction of high-performance software router systems on commodity hardware.

                The paper introduces Snap, a framework for packet processing that exploits the parallelism available on modern GPUs, while remaining flexible, with packet processing tasks implemented as simple modular elements that are composed to build fully functional routers and switches. Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion.

                The paper introduces ClickOS, a high-performance, virtualized software middlebox platform. ClickOS virtual machines are small (5MB), boot quickly (about 30 milliseconds), add little delay (45 microseconds), and over one hundred of them can be concurrently run while saturating a 10Gb pipe on a commodity server. A wide range of middleboxes is implemented, including a firewall, a carrier-grade NAT and a load balancer, and the evaluations suggest that ClickOS can handle packets in the millions per second.

                BESS is the Berkeley Extensible Software Switch developed at the University of California, Berkeley and at Nefeli Networks. BESS is heavily inspired by the Click modular router, representing a packet processing pipeline as a dataflow (multi)graph that consists of modules, each of which implements a NIC feature, and ports that act as sources and sinks for this pipeline. Packets received at a port flow through the pipeline to another port, and each module in the pipeline performs module-specific operations on packets.

A new architecture called mSwitch is proposed and four distinct modules are implemented on top: a learning bridge, an accelerated Open vSwitch module, a protocol demultiplexer for userspace protocol stacks, and a filtering module that can direct packets to virtualized middleboxes.

                NetBricks is an NFV framework adopting the "graph-based" pipeline abstraction and embracing type checking and safe runtimes to provide isolation efficiently in software, providing the same memory isolation as containers and VMs without incurring the same performance penalties. The new isolation technique is called zero-copy software isolation.

                PISCES is a software switch derived from Open vSwitch (OVS), a hypervisor switch whose behavior is customized using P4. PISCES is not hard-wired to specific protocols; this independence makes it easy to add new features. The paper also shows how the compiler can analyze the high-level P4 specification to optimize forwarding performance; the evaluations show that PISCES performs comparably to OVS but PISCES programs are about 40 times shorter than equivalent OVS source code.

                The authors argue that, instead of enforcing the same universal fast-path semantics to all OpenFlow applications and optimizing for the common case, as it is done in Open vSwitch, a programmable software switch should rather automatically specialize its dataplane piecemeal with respect to the configured workload. They introduce ESwitch, a switch architecture that uses on-the-fly template-based code generation to compile any OpenFlow pipeline into efficient machine code, which can then be readily used as the switch fast-path, delivering superior packet processing speed, improved latency and CPU scalability, and predictable performance.

                 The paper makes the observation that data-plane compilation is fundamentally static, i.e., the input of the compiler is a fixed description of the forwarding plane semantics and the output is code that can accommodate any packet processing behavior set by the controller at runtime. The authors advocate a dynamic approach to data plane compilation instead, where not just the semantics but the intended behavior is also input to the compiler, opening the door to a handful of runtime optimization opportunities that can be leveraged to improve the performance of custom-compiled datapaths beyond what is possible in a static setting.

                This paper presents the design and experience with Andromeda, the network virtualization stack underlying the Google Cloud Platform. Andromeda is designed around the Hoverboard programming model, which uses gateways for the long tail of low bandwidth flows enabling the control plane to program network connectivity for tens of thousands of VMs in seconds, and applies per-flow processing to elephant flows only. The paper cites statistics indicating that above 80% of VM pairs never talk to each other in a deployment and only 1–2% generate sufficient traffic to warrant per-flow processing. The architecture also uses a high-performance OS bypass software packet processing path for CPU-intensive per packet operations, implemented on coprocessor threads.

                Netmap is a framework that enables commodity operating systems to handle the millions of packets per seconds, without requiring custom hardware or changes to applications. The idea is to eliminate inefficiencies in OSes' standard packet processing datapaths: per-packet dynamic memory allocations are removed by preallocating resources, system call overheads are amortized over large I/O batches, and memory copies are eliminated by sharing buffers and metadata between kernel and userspace, while still protecting access to device registers and other kernel memory areas.

            SwitchBlade is a platform for rapidly deploying custom protocols on programmable hardware. SwitchBlade uses a pipeline-based design that allows individual hardware modules to be enabled or disabled on the fly, integrates common packet-processing functions as hardware modules enabling different protocols to use these functions without having to resynthesize hardware, and uses a customizable forwarding engine that supports both longest-prefix matching in the packet header and exact matching on a hash value. SwitchBlade also allows multiple custom data planes to operate in parallel on the same physical hardware, while providing complete isolation for protocols running in parallel.

            This seminal paper presents RMT to overcome two limitations in current switching chips and OpenFlow: (1) conventional hardware switches are rigid, allowing "Match-Action" processing on only a fixed set of fields, and (2) the OpenFlow specification only defines a limited repertoire of packet processing actions. The RMT (Reconfigurable Match Tables) model is a RISC-inspired pipelined architecture for switching chips, including an essential minimal set of action primitives to specify how headers are processed in hardware. RMT allows the forwarding plane to be changed in the field without modifying hardware.

            The paper is motivated by the challenges involved in consistent updates of distributed network configurations, given the complexity of modern switch datapaths and the exposed opaque configuration mechanisms. The authors demonstrate that even simple rule updates result in inconsistent packet switching in multi-table datapaths. The main contribution of the paper is a hardware design that supports a transactional configuration mechanism, providing strong switch-level atomicity: all packets traversing the datapath will encounter either the old configuration or the new one, and never an inconsistent mix of the two. The approach is prototyped using the NetFPGA hardware platform.

            This paper focuses on accelerating NFs with FPGAs. However, FPGA is predominately programmed using low-level hardware description languages (HDLs), which are hard to code and difficult to debug. More importantly, HDLs are almost inaccessible for most software programmers. This paper presents ClickNP, a FPGA-accelerated platform, which is highly flexible as it is completely programmable using high-level C-like languages and exposes a modular programming abstraction that resembles Click Modular Router, and also high performance.

            A follow-up to the RMT paper. dRMT (disaggregated Reconfigurable Match-Action Table) is a new architecture for programmable switches, which overcomes two important restrictions of RMT: (1) table memory is local to an RMT pipeline stage, implying that memory not used by one stage cannot be reclaimed by another, and (2) RMT is hardwired to always sequentially execute matches followed by actions as packets traverse pipeline stages. dRMT resolves both issues by disaggregating the memory and compute resources of a programmable switch, moving table memories out of pipeline stages and into a centralized pool that is accessible through a crossbar. In addition, dRMT replaces RMT's pipeline stages with a cluster of processors that can execute match and action operations in any order.

            The authors ask what switch hardware primitives are required to support an expressive language of network performance questions. They present a performance query language, Marple, modeled on familiar functional constructs, backed by a new programmable key-value store primitive on switch hardware that performs flexible aggregations at line rate and scales to millions of keys. Marple can express switch queries that could previously run only on end hosts, while Marple queries only occupy a modest fraction of a switch's hardware resources.

        It is often believed that the performance of programmable network processors is lower than hard‐coded chips. There exists interesting literature questioning this assumption and exploring these overheads empirically. We also discuss opportunities coming from Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) acceleration, e.g., for packet processing, as well as from hybrid hardware/software architectures in general.

            Industry insight holds that programmable network processors are of lower performance than their hard-coded counterparts, such as Ethernet chips. The paper argues that, contrast to the common view, the overhead of programmability is relatively low, and that the apparent difference between programmable and hard-coded chips is not primarily due to programmability itself, but because the internal balance of programmable network processors is tuned to more complex use cases.

            The paper opens the debate as to whether Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are useful for accelerating software-based routing and packet handling applications. The authors argue that for many such applications the benefits arise less from the GPU hardware itself than from the expression of the problem in a language such as CUDA or OpenCL that facilitates memory latency hiding and vectorization through massive concurrency. They then demonstrate that applying a similar style of optimization to algorithm implementations, a CPU-only implementation is more resource efficient than the version running on the GPU.

            The paper presents an architecture to allow high-speed forwarding even with large rule tables and fast updates, by combining the best of hardware and software processing. The CacheFlow system caches the most popular rules in the small TCAM and relies on software to handle the small amount of cache-miss traffic. The authors observe that one cannot blindly apply existing cache-replacement algorithms, because of dependencies between rules with overlapping patterns. Rather long dependency chains must be broken to cache smaller groups of rules while preserving the semantics of the policy.

            This is the answer to the question raised by the "Raising the Bar for Using GPUs" paper. Kalia et al. argue that the key enabler for high packet-processing performance is the inherent feature of GPU that automatically hides memory access latency rather than its parallel computation power and claim that CPU can outperform or achieve a similar performance as GPU if its code is re-arranged to run concurrently with memory access. This paper revists these claims and find, with eight popular algorithms widely used in network applications, that (a) there are many compute-bound algorithms that do benefit from the parallel computation capacity of GPU while CPU-based optimizations fail to help, and (b) the relative performance advantage of CPU over GPU in most applications is due to data transfer bottleneck in PCIe communication of discrete GPU rather than lack of capacity of GPU itself.

            The authors argue that the primary reason for high memory and processing overheads inherent to packet processing applications is the inefficient use of the memory and I/O resources by commodity NICs. They propose FlexNIC, a flexible network DMA interface that can be used to reduce packet processing overheads; FlexNIC allows services to install packet processing rules into the NIC, which then executes simple operations on packets while exchanging them with host memory. This moves some of the packet processing traditionally done in software to the NIC, where it can be done flexibly and at high speed.

            The paper presents Floem, a set of programming abstractions for NIC-accelerated applications to ease developing server applications that offload computation and data to a NIC accelerator. Floem simplifies typical offloading issues, like data placement and caching, partitioning of code and its parallelism, and communication strategies between program components across devices, by providing language-level abstractions for logical and physical queues, global per-packet state, remote caching; and interfacing with external application code. The paper also presents evaluations to demonstrate how these abstractions help explore a space of NIC-offloading designs for real-world applications, including a key-value store and a distributed real-time data analytics system.

            The paper addresses the noisy neighbor problem in the context of NICs. Using data from a major public cloud provider, the paper systematically characterizes how performance isolation can break in virtualization stacks and finds a fundamental tradeoff between isolation and efficiency. The paper then proposes PicNIC, the Predictable Virtualized NIC, a new NIC design that shares resources efficiently in the common case while rapidly reacting to ensure isolation in order to provide predictable performance for isolated workloads. PicNIC builds on three constructs to quickly detect isolation breakdown and to enforce it when necessary: CPU-fair weighted fair queues at receivers, receiver-driven congestion control for backpressure, and sender-side admission control with shaping. Evaluations show that this combination ensures isolation for VMs at sub-millisecond timescales with negligible overhead.

    At the heart of programmable data planes lies the question of which abstractions and programming interfaces to provide. We first review literature on low-level APIs, including OpenFlow and P4, and then discuss more high-level languages and compilers, including DevoFlow and the Frenetic framework. Particular focus is put on stateful abstractions. We then extend our review to literature on parser design as well as scheduling, and in particular, the question whether there exist universal packet scheduling algorithms.

We then proceed by discussing P4 and its alternatives and use cases. We also review, among other, high-performance packet processing languages and make the case for intermediate representations for programmable data planes.

        We then proceed to more high-level languages and abstractions, discuss programming languages such as Pyretic, systems such as Maple, or novel switch designs like HARMLESS to seamlessly add SDN capability to legacy network gear.

OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries.

                This paper describes a model which combines a parallel model and heterogeneous multiprocessor implementations. The parallel packet processing model uses coarse-grained SPMD parallelism to free users from thread management and it requires the host system to locate protocol headers in the packet before a parallel copy of the program executes. The packetC language abstracts and encapsulates familiar packet processing data sets and operations into new aggregate data types and operators, e.g., for packets, databases and searchsets.

                As an alternative to P4, Protocol-Oblivious Forwarding (POF) is presented as a key enabler for highly flexible and programmable SDN. The goal is to remove any dependency on protocol-specific configurations on the forwarding elements and, in addition to P4's stateless design, enhance the data-path with new stateful instructions to support genuine software defined networking behavior. A generic flow instruction set (FIS) is defined to fulfill this purpose and both hardware-based and open source software-based prototypes are shown to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of POF.

P4 has three goals: (1) reconfigurability, in that programmers can change the way switches process packets once they are deployed, (2) protocol independence, in that switches are not tied to any specific network protocols, and (3) target independence, in that programmers can describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics of the underlying hardware. The paper demonstrates P4 by showing configure a switch to add a new hierarchical label.

                This paper is motivated by the observation that OpenFlow, in its original design, imposes great overheads, involving the switch’s control-plane too often. In order to meet the needs of high-performance networks, the authors propose and evaluate DevoFlow, which provides less fine-grained visibility, at significantly lower costs. In a case study, the authors show that DevoFlow can load-balance data center traffic as well as fine-grained solutions, but with much fewer flow table entries and using much fewer control messages.

Pyretic improves on Frenetic (an earlier incarnation of a similar language) by adding support for sequential composition, the use of topology abstractions to define what each module can see and do with the network, and an abstract packet model that introduces virtual fields into packets. Modular applications are written using the static policy language NetCore, which provides primitive actions, matching predicates, query policies, and policies.

                The paper presents Maple, a system that simplifies SDN programming by (1) allowing a programmer to use a standard programming language to design an arbitrary, centralized algorithm, to decide the behavior of an entire network, and (2) providing an abstraction that the programmer-defined, centralized policy runs on every packet entering a network, and hence is oblivious to the challenge of translating a high-level policy into sets of rules on distributed individual switches. To implement algorithmic policies efficiently, Maple includes not only a highly-efficient multicore scheduler, but more importantly a novel tracing runtime optimizer that can automatically record reusable policy decisions, offload work to switches when possible, and keep switch flow tables up-to-date by dynamically tracing the dependency of policy decisions on packet contents as well as the environment.

                The paper contributes just what is stated in the title, a new network programming language called NetKAT that is based on a solid mathematical foundation. Formerly, the design of network dataplane programming languages was largely ad hoc, driven more by the needs of applications and the capabilities of network hardware than by foundational principles. NetKAT solves this problem by (1) proposing primitives for filtering, modifying, and transmitting packets, operators for combining programs in parallel and in sequence, and a Kleene star operator for iteration, and (2) presenting a series of proofs that the language is sound and complete.

This way, HARMLESS enables a quick and easy leap into SDN, combining the rapid innovation and upgrade cycles of software switches with the port density and cost-efficiency of hardware-based appliances into a fully dataplane-transparent and vendor-neutral solution. HARMLESS incurs an order of magnitude smaller initial expenditure for an SDN deployment than existing turnkey vendor SDN solutions while it yields matching, or even better data plane performance for smaller enterprises.

Such an algorithm can be useful to verify and compare the output of different dataplane compilers, to find new bugs existing network dataplanes, or to check the equivalence of FIB updates in a production network. The evaluation shows that equivalence is an easy way to find bugs, scales well to relatively large programs and uncovers subtle issues otherwise difficult to find.

      preamble: While OpenFlow match/action table abstractions are stateless, there are many efforts toward devising a stateful data plane programming abstraction, e.g., based on finite state machines, for supporting more dynamic applications. We discuss such approaches as well as first workload characterizations of stateful networking applications. We also review literature on the challenge of consistent state migration and elastic scaling, and discuss security implications.

            The paper tackles the challenge to devise a stateful data plane programming abstraction (versus the stateless OpenFlow match/action table abstraction) which still entails high performance and remains consistent with vendors' preference for closed platforms. The authors posit that a promising answer revolves around the usage of extended finite state machines, as an extension (super-set) of the OpenFlow match/action abstraction, turn the proposed abstraction into an actual table-based API, and show how it can be supported by (mostly) reusing core primitives already implemented in OpenFlow devices.

            The paper proposes FAST (Flow-level State Transitions) as a new switch primitive for software-defined networks. With FAST, the controller simply preinstalls a state machine and switches can automatically record flow state transitions by matching incoming packets to installed filters. FAST can support a variety of dynamic applications, and can be readily implemented with commodity switch components and software switches.

            SNAP offers a simpler "centralized" stateful programming model on top of the simple match-action paradigm offered by OpenFlow. SNAP programs are developed on a one-big-switch abstraction and may contain reads and writes to global, persistent arrays, allowing programmers to implement a broad range of stateful applications. The SNAP compiler then distributes, places, and optimizes access to these stateful arrays, discovering read/write dependencies and translating one-big-switch programs into an efficient internal representation based on a novel variant of binary decision diagrams.

            This paper shows how to program data-plane algorithms in a high-level language and compile those programs into low-level microcode that can run on programmable line-rate switching chips. The key challenge is that many data-plane algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. To achieve line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms, the paper introduces the notion of a packet transaction: a sequential packet-processing code block that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks. The idea is developed in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane algorithms, and many examples are shown that can be run at line rate with modest estimated chip-area overhead.

The proposed approach, named "Open Packet Processor" (OPP), shows the viability of eXtended Finite State Machines (XFSM) as low-level data plane programming abstraction. Platform independence is accomplished by decoupling the implementation of hardware primitives from their usage by an application formally described via an abstract XFSM.

The key insight is to perform state migration entirely within the data plane by piggybacking state updates on live traffic. To minimize the overhead, Swing State only migrates the states that cannot be safely reconstructed at the destination switch. A prototype of Swing State for P4 is also described.

The StatelessNF processing instances are architected around efficient pipelines utilizing DPDK for high performance network I/O, packaged as Docker containers for easy deployment, and a data store interface optimized based on the expected request patterns to efficiently access a RAMCloud-based data store. A network-wide orchestrator monitors the instances for load and failure, manages instances to scale and provide resilience, and leverages an OpenFlow-based network to direct traffic to instances.

            Elastic scaling is a central promise of NFV but has been hard to realize in practice, because most Network Functions (NFs) are stateful and this state need to be shared across NF instances. The paper presents S6, building on the insight that a distributed shared state abstraction is well-suited to the NFV context. State is organized as a distributed shared object (DSO) space, extended with techniques designed to meet the need for elasticity and high-performance in NFV workloads.

It turns out that in general the answer is "no"; however, the authors manage to show that the classical Least Slack Time First (LSTF) scheduling algorithm comes closest to being universal and it can closely replay a wide range of scheduling algorithms. LSTF is evaluated as to whether in practice it can meet various network-wide objectives; the authors find that LSTF performs comparable to the state-of-the-art for each of performance metric.

            Similarly to the "Universal Packet Scheduling" paper, this paper presents another design for a programmable packet scheduler, which allows scheduling algorithms, potentially algorithms that are unknown today, to be programmed into a switch without requiring hardware redesign. The design uses the property that scheduling algorithms make two decisions, in what order to schedule packets and when to schedule them, and exploits that in many scheduling algorithms definitive decisions on these two questions can be made when packets are enqueued. The resultant design uses a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority queue that maintains the scheduling order or time.

            The paper discusses how to leverage configurable per-packet processing and the ability to maintain mutable state inside switches to achieve fair bandwidth allocation across all traversing flows. The problem is that implementing fair queuing mechanisms in high-speed switches is expensive, since they require complex flow classification, buffer allocation, and scheduling on a per-packet basis. The proposed dequeuing scheduler, called Rotating Strict Priority scheduler, simulates an ideal round-robin scheme where each active flow transmits a single bit of data in every round, which allows to transmit packets from multiple queues in approximately sorted order.

            The trend toward increasing link speeds and slowdown in the scaling of CPU speeds, leads to a situation where packet scheduling in software results in lower precision and higher CPU utilization. While by offloading packet scheduling to the hardware (e.g., the NIC), this drawback can be overcome, one still would like to retain the flexibility benefits of software packet schedulers: packet scheduling in hardware should hence be programmable. Shrivastav proposes a generalization of the Push-In-First-Out (PIFO) primitive used by state-of-the-art hardware packet schedulers: Push-In-Extract-Out (PIEO) maintains an ordered list of elements, but allows dequeue from arbitrary positions in the list by supporting a programmable predicate-based filtering at dequeue. PIEO supports most scheduling (work-conserving and non-work conserving) algorithms and can be implemented scalably in hardware.

            Push-In First-Out (PIFO) queues are hardware primitives which enable programmable packet scheduling by allowing to perfectly reorder packets at line rate. While promising, implementing PIFO queues in hardware and at scale is not easy: only hardware designs (not implementations) exist and they can only support about 1000 flows. This paper introduces SP-PIFO, a programmable packet scheduler which closely approximates the behavior of PIFO queues using strict-priority queues-- at line rate, at scale, and on existing devices.

        This paper presents the packet classifier algorithm that underlies the Open vSwitch fast-path. Packet classification requires matching each packet against a database of flow rules and forwarding the packet according to the highest priority rule. The paper introduces a generic packet classification algorithm, called Tuple Space Search (TSS), based on the observation that real databases typically use only a small number of distinct field lengths. Thus, by mapping rules to tuples even a simple linear search of the tuple space can provide significant speedup over naive linear search over the filters. Each tuple is maintained as a hash table that can be searched in one memory access.

        Content-addressable memory (CAM) and Ternary CAM (TCAM) chips are the most important component in programmable switch ASICs, performing packet classification according to configurable header fields, matching rules, and priority, in a single clock cycle using dedicated comparison circuitry. The paper surveys recent developments in the design of large-capacity CAMs. The main CAM-design challenge is to reduce power consumption associated with the large amount of parallel active circuitry, without sacrificing speed or memory density. The paper reviews CAM-design techniques at the circuit level and at the architectural level.

        Programmable routers often need to support a separate forwarding information base (FIB) for each virtual router provisioned by the controller, which leads to memory scaling challenges. In this paper, a small, shared FIB data structure is presented and a fast lookup algorithm that capitalize on the commonality of IP prefixes between each FIB. Experiments with real packet traces and routing tables show that the approach achieves much lower memory requirements and considerably faster lookup times.

        Ternary Content-Addressable Memories (TCAMs) have become the industrial standard for high-throughput packet classification, and as such, for programmable switch ASICs. However, one major drawback of TCAMs is their high power consumption. In this paper, a practical and efficient solution is proposed which introduces a smart pre-classifier to reduce power consumption of TCAMs for multi-dimensional packet classification. The classifier dimension is reduced by pre-classifying a packet on two header fields, source and destination IP addresses. Then, the high dimensional problem can use only a small portion of a TCAM for a given packet. The pre-classifier is built such that a given packet matches at most one entry in the pre-classifier, and each rule is stored only once in one of the TCAM blocks, which avoids rule replication. The presented solution uses commodity TCAMs.

The state-of-the-art in compressed data structures yields a static entropy-compressed FIB representation with asymptotically optimal lookup. Since this data structure results too slow for practical uses, the authors redesign the venerable prefix tree to also admit entropy bounds and support lookup in optimal time and update in nearly optimal time.

        Efficient packet classification is a core concern for programmable network devices, but it is also very difficult to implement efficiently. Traditional multi-field classification approaches, in both software and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAMs), entail trade-offs between (memory) space and (lookup) time. In this work, a novel approach is presented, which identifies properties of many classifiers that can be implemented in linear space and with worst-case guaranteed logarithmic time and allows the addition of more fields including range constraints without impacting space and time complexities.

        The authors argue that a hybrid software-hardware switch may help in lowering the flow-table entries installation time, and present ShadowSwitch (sSw), an OpenFlow switch prototype that implements such a design. sSw builds on two key observations. First, software tables are very fast to be updated, hence, forwarding tables updates always happen in software first and, eventually, entries are moved to the TCAM to achieve higher overall throughput and offload the software forwarder. Lookup in software is performed only in case there are no entries matching a packet in hardware. Second, since deleting entries from TCAM is much faster than adding them, ShadowSwitch may translate an entry installation in a mix of installation in software tables and deletion from hardware tables.

PPS converts the string search problem into a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) representation and then maps the DFA into a sequence of forwarding tables implemented in the switch pipeline. The evaluations show that PPS demonstrates significantly higher throughput and lower latency than CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs.

    A main motivation for programmable data planes are the novel applications they enable. We identify and, in the following, will discuss five main categories: applications related to resilient and efficient forwarding, in-network computation, consensus, telemetry, and load-balancing.

    One may wonder, what aspects of SDN and programmable data plane make these applications possible? There is probably no single perfect answer to this question.

    Applications related to in-network computation typically leverage new hardware-assisted primitive operations, supported in the data plane, to provide novel functionality and improve performance. Resilient and efficient routing (and to some extent load-balancing) leverage the unique and unprecedented programmatic control over the way traffic flows through the network, e.g., to implement advanced functionality in the data plane (whereas formerly it used to be handled, e.g., in the control plane). Measurement applications benefit from the improved traffic visibility and/or from the improved latency and throughput at which high-volume and highly variable traffic can be handled, if offloaded to the data plane. Reduced latency and improved reaction time is arguably also a key reason for consensus applications. Furthermore, measurement applications benefit from the fact that they can be expressed in terms of simple primitives (e.g., sketches). We also note that such applications are not limited to be "performed (only) in the network": for example, telemetry can (and today often does) occur outside the network. That said, telemetry applications also benefit from the new visibility into the network, e.g., queues occupation levels of the switches along the path. Many interesting applications also arise from offloading applications that were formerly handled in a separate middlebox to programmable switches.

    In general, any application designed for a non-programmable device may benefit from the flexibilities introduced by a programmable counterpart (e.g., allowing to evolve the application). Also, applications with a strong networking component (e.g., request-response patterns) are more likely to benefit from in-network services, as much communication traffic naturally traverses the network anyway.

      anchor: resilient-fwd

            This paper is motivated by the limitations of existing IP multipath protocols relying on per-flow static hashing, which can result in suboptimal throughput and bandwidth losses due to long-term collisions. Hedera is a dynamic flow scheduling system for multi-stage switch topologies as they often appear in data centers. Hedera uses flow information from constituent switches and reroutes traffic to non-conflicting routes accordingly. The authors show that the more global view of routing and traffic demands allows Hedera to see bottlenecks that switch-local schedulers cannot, and to adaptively schedule the switching fabric in a way which significantly improves aggregate network utilization with minimal overheads.

Their Data-Driven Connectivity (DDC) approach, which can handle arbitrary delays and losses, relies on simple state changes which can done at packet rates. In particular, DCC relies on link reversal routing, adapted to suit the data plane, e.g., to handle message loss.

The proposed method, Blink, uses exploits TCP-induced signals to detect failures; when compounded over multiple flows, TCP behavior creates a strong and characteristic failure signal. Blink analyzes TCP flows, at line rate, to reliably and quickly detect major traffic disruptions and recover data-plane connectivity. Evaluation results on a P4 implementation of Blink running on real Tofino switch indicate that it can achieve sub-second rerouting for realistic Internet traffic and scales to protect large fractions of realistic traffic.

            This paper makes the case that many massive-scale information processing and real-time applications may benefit from pushing data-aggregation load from the network edge into the network. This is because in many of these applications data is aggregated during the computation process and the output size is a fraction of the input size. The authors explore a different point in the design space, whereby instead of increasing the network bandwidth they rather implement a MapReduce-like system on a cluster design that uses a direct-connect network topology, with servers directly linked to other servers, and letting servers to perform in-network aggregation of data during the shuffle phase. Camdoop was shown to significantly reduce network traffic and provide high performance increase.

Mai et al. propose to depart from performing data aggregation at edge servers, but rather, do it more efficiently along network paths. The presented software platform, NETAGG, supports on-path aggregation for network-bound partition/aggregation applications. It is based on a middlebox-like design, in which dedicated servers that can execute aggregation functions provided by applications. The authors demonstrate that NETAGG can improve throughput substantially.

IncBricks is a hardware-software co-designed system that supports caching in the network using a programmable network middlebox. As a key-value store accelerator, our prototype lowers request latency by over 30% and doubles throughput for 1024 byte values in a common cluster configuration. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of in-network computing and that efficient datacenter network request processing is possible if we carefully split the computation across programmable switches, network accelerators, and end hosts.

            The main contribution of this work is providing a set of general building blocks that mask the limitations of programmable switches (limited state, support limited types of operations, limited per-packet computation) using approximation techniques and thereby enabling the implementation of realistic network protocols. These building blocks are then used to tackle the network resource allocation problem within datacenters and realize approximate variants of congestion control and load balancing protocols, such as XCP, RCP, and CONGA, that require explicit support from the network. The evaluations show that the proposed approximations are accurate and that they do not exceed the hardware resource limits associated with flexible switches.

            The paper presents N2Net, a system that implements binary neural networks using commodity switching chips deployed in network switches and routers. N2Net shows that these devices can run simple neural network models, whose input is encoded in the network packets' header, at packet processing speeds (billions of packets per second). Furthermore, the authors' experience highlights that switching chips could support even more complex models, provided that some minor and cheap modifications to the chip's design are applied.

        Another interesting application for programmable data planes is related to consensus algorithms: the coordination among controllers or switches may be performed most efficiently directly on the network devices. Over the last years, several interesting first approaches have been reported in the literature, not only to compute consensus but also to provide different notions of consistency more generally.

            This paper explores the possibility of implementing the widely deployed Paxos consensus protocol in network devices. Two different approaches are presented: (1) a detailed design description for implementing the full Paxos logic in SDN switches, which identifies a sufficient set of required OpenFlow extensions, and (2) an alternative, optimistic protocol which can be implemented without changes to the OpenFlow API, but relies on assumptions about how the network orders messages. Although neither of these protocols can be fully implemented without changes to the underlying switch firmware, the authors argue that such changes are feasible in existing hardware.

            SwitchKV implements a key-value store system leveraging SDN network switches to balance the cache servers workload routing the traffic based on the content of the network packets. To identify the content of a packet, the key of a key-value entry is encoded in the packet header. A hybrid cache strategy keeps the cache and switch forwarding rules updated, finally achieving significant improvements in both system's throughput and latency.

            The paper considers the design of consistent distributed control planes in which the actions performed on the data plane by different controllers need to be synchronized. The authors propose a synchronization framework for based on atomic transactions implemented in the data plane switches and show that their approach allows to realize fundamental consensus primitives in the presence of controller failures. They also discuss applications for consistent policy composition. With a proof-of-concept implementation, it is demonstrated that the framework can be implemented using the standard OpenFlow protocol.

NetChain exploits programmable switches to store data and process queries entirely in the network data plane. This eliminates the query processing at coordination servers and cuts the end-to-end latency to as little as half of an RTT. New protocols and algorithms are designed for NetChain guarantees strong consistency and handles switch failures efficiently.

            Jeyakumar et al. present an approach to give end-hosts visibility into network behavior and to quickly introduce new data plane functionality, via a new Tiny Packet Program (TTP) interface. TTPs are embedded into packets by endhosts and can actively query and manipulate internal network state. The idea is motivated by a clear work division: switches forward and execute TTPs in-band at line rate, and endhosts perform arbitrary (and easily updated) computation on network state. The paper presents a number of use case descriptions motivating In‐band Network Telemetry (INT).

Two strategies are proposes, called Maximum Load Rule First (MLRF) and Large Flow First (LFF), both of which LFF satisfy the flow aggregation constraints (determined by associated routing policies) and have low-complexity.

HULA is a more flexible and scalable data-plane load-balancing algorithm in which each switch tracks congestion only for the best path to a destination through a neighboring switch. HULA is designed for programmable switches and is programmed in P4.

            Memcached is an in-memory key-value distributed caching solution, commonly used by web servers for fast content delivery. In order to deal with skewed distributions of key popularity in key-value stores, the authors propose and implement MBalancer, a switch-based L7 load balancing scheme, which offloads requests from bottleneck Memcached servers. MBalancer runs as an SDN application, identifies the (typically small number of) hot keys, duplicates these hot keys to many (or all) Memcached servers, and adjusts the switches' forwarding tables accordingly. Experiences with an implementation of MBalancer on a hardware-based OpenFlow switch indicate significant throughput boost and latency reduction.

With the advent of programmable switch ASICs, which can run complex logic at line rate, the paper revisits this principle, by accelerating the control plane offloading some of its tasks directly to the network hardware. Some simple control plane functionality can already be successfully offloaded to P4 hardware, including failure detection and notification, connectivity retrieval, and even policy-based routing protocols, but complex cases involve several tradeoffs and limitations; the paper outlines these and sketches interesting future research directions towards hardware-software co-design of network control planes.

Ethane couples extremely simple flow-based Ethernet switches with a centralized controller that manages the admittance and routing of flows. While radical, this design is backwards-compatible with existing hosts and switches. Ethane was implemented in both hardware and software, supporting both wired and wireless hosts.

In particular, SoftCell allows to flexibly route traffic through sequences of middleboxes based on subscriber attributes and applications. Scalability is achieved by minimizing the size of the forwarding tables, using aggregation, and by performing packet classification at the access switches, next to the base stations.

These characteristics led to a Software Defined Networking architecture using OpenFlow to control relatively simple switches built from merchant silicon.

            To support deploying SDNs into the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), the paper presents the design and evaluation of a system architecture for a software EPC that achieves high and scalable performance. The authors postulate that the poor scaling of existing EPC systems stems from the manner in which the system is decomposed, which leads to device state being duplicated across multiple components, which in turn results in frequent interactions between the different components. An alternate approach is proposed in which state for a single device is consolidated in one location and EPC functions are reorganized for efficient access to this consolidated state. A prototype for PEPC is also presented, as a software EPC that implements the key components of the design.

            The authors leverage the characteristics of the P4 programming language to provide a method for estimating the packet forwarding latency as a function of the data path program. They analyze the impact of different P4 constructs on packet processing latency for three state-of-the-art P4 devices: a Netronome SmartNIC, the NetFPGA-SUME, and the T4P4S DPDK-based software switch. Besides comparing the performance of these three targets, derived results are used to propose a method for estimating the average packet latency, at compilation time, of arbitrary P4-based network functions implemented using the surveyed P4 constructs. The proposed method is finally validated using a set of realistic network functions, which shows that the method estimates the average packet latency with sub-microsecond precision.

            Extending programmability into the data plane introduces new threat models, in particular related to compilers used to map data plane languages, such as P4 to software or hardware targets. P4Fuzz aims at uncovering vulnerabilities in such compilers through automated compiler fuzzing. The author's compiler found several bugs in production compilers that since have been acknowledged and fixed by the community.

            FlowLens is a system that leverages commodity programmable switches to efficiently support multi-purpose ML-based security applications. FlowLens collects features of packet distributions at line speed and classifies flows directly on the switches, enabling network operators to re-purpose this measurement primitive at run-time to serve a different flow classification task. To cope with the resource constraints of programmable switches, FlowLens computes for each flow a memory-efficient representation of relevant features, named "flow  marker". Despite its small size, a flow marker contains enough information to perform accurate flow classification. We evaluated our system in three usage scenarios: covert channel detection, website fingerprinting, and botnet chatter detection.

            Is it possible to patch software bugs in P4 programs without human involvement? The paper shows that this is partially possible in many cases due to advances in software testing and the structure of P4 programs. The insight is that runtime verification can detect bugs, even those that are not detected at compile-time, with machine learning-guided fuzzing. This enables a more automated and real-time localization of bugs in P4 programs using software testing techniques like Tarantula. Once the bug in a P4 program is localized, the faulty code can be patched due to the programmable nature of P4. In addition, platform-dependent bugs can be detected. From P4_14 to P4_16 (latest version), the key observation is that as the programmable blocks increase, the patchability of P4 programs increases accordingly. To this end, the authors design, develop, and evaluate P6 that (a) detects, (b) localizes, and (c) patches bugs in P4 programs with minimal human interaction. P6 tests P4 switch non-intrusively, i.e., requires no modification to the P4 program for detecting and localizing bugs. The authors used a P6 prototype to detect and patch seven existing bugs in eight publicly available P4 application programs deployed on two different switch platforms: behavioral model (bmv2) and Tofino. The evaluation shows that P6 significantly outperforms bug detection baselines while generating fewer packets and patches bugs in P4 programs such as switch.p4 without triggering any regressions.

            This paper presents the design and early implementation of p4rl, a system that uses reinforcement learning-guided fuzz testing to execute the verification of P4 switches automatically at runtime. p4rl system uses novel user-friendly query language, p4q to conveniently specify the intended properties in simple conditional statements (if-else) and check the actual runtime behavior of the P4 switch against such properties. In p4rl, user-specified p4q queries with the control plane configuration, Agent, and the Reward System guide the fuzzing process to trigger runtime bugs automatically during Agent training. To illustrate the strength of p4rl, an early prototype of p4rl system is developed and evaluated to execute runtime verification of a P4 network device, e.g., L3 (Layer-3) switch. Initial results are promising and show that p4rl automatically detects diverse bugs while outperforming the baseline approach.

            The prevailing wisdom is that a software-defined network (SDN) operates under the premise that the logically centralized control plane has an accurate representation of the actual data plane state. Unfortunately, bugs, misconfigurations, faults or attacks can introduce inconsistencies between the network control and the data plane that can undermine the correct operation at runtime. Through experiments, the authors realize that P4 SDNs are no exception, and are prone to similar problems. With the aim to verify the control-data plane inconsistency, the authors present the design and implementation of P4Consist, a system to detect the inconsistency between control and data plane in P4 SDNs. P4Consist generates active probe-based traffic continuously or periodically as an input to the P4 SDNs to check whether the actual behavior on the data plane corresponds to the expected control plane behavior. In P4Consist, the control plane and the data plane generate independent reports which are later, compared to verify the control-data plane consistency. The previous works in the field of monitoring and verification mostly aim to test the P4 programs through static analysis and thus, are insufficient to verify the network consistency at runtime. Experiments with the prototype implementation of P4Consist are promising and show that P4Consist can verify the control-data plane consistency in the complex datacenter 4-ary fat-tree (20 switches) and multipath grid (4, 9 and 16 switches) topologies with 60k rules per switch within a minimum time of 4 minutes. At the same time, P4Consist scales to multiple source-destination pairs to detect control-data plane inconsistency.
